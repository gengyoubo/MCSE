# Mod Introduction<br>
### Minecraft Science module is divided into four parts: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Geology. I will introduce the interesting parts of each part.
# Physics<br>
In the physics chapter, the ultimate goal is to create advanced machinery and advanced generators. Unlike Thermal Expansion and Mechanical Dynamics, the player needs to find knowledge of physics in order to create the machinery, otherwise they cannot advance the process.
# Chemistry<br>
In the Chemistry chapter, the player will need to find word mines, which they will then need to use to create a variety of chemicals. In addition to text mines, the player will need to use “Reality Powder” to transform the text chemicals into something usable. This is the most important feature of Chemistry!
# Creature<br>
In the Creature Chapter, the player needs to research the various traits of the creatures and then use them to strengthen the player at a later stage. This is the best feature of the creature chapter!
# Geology<br>
In the Geology Chapter, in the early stages, players may encounter various natural disasters. In the middle and late stages, the player may create geological probes to find various ores. Alternatively, the player can create artificial (natural) disasters to persecute others.
# Basic Processes<br>
In the beginning, you need to avoid all kinds of natural disasters and then search for word mines. Of course, it's not enough to have text ore, you need case-sensitive “Case Powder” and realizable “Realized Super Particles”. For example, if you collect S and i and n ores, then you need to use case-sensitive powder to turn S into s and synthesize it into sin, or if you collect f and e ores, then you need to use case-sensitive powder to turn f into F and synthesize it into Fe, and then you need to use realizable super particles to turn it into realizable iron. ...... And so on and so forth.
